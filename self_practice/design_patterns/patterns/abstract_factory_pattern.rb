#Imagine that youâ€™re creating a furniture shop simulator. Your code consists of classes that represent:
# A family of related products, say: Chair + Sofa + CoffeeTable.
# Several variants of this family. For example, products Chair + Sofa + CoffeeTable are available in these variants: Modern, Victorian, ArtDeco.

#SOLUTION
# The first thing the Abstract Factory pattern suggests is to explicitly declare interfaces for each distinct product of the product 
# family (e.g., chair, sofa or coffee table). Then you can make all variants of products follow those interfaces. For example, all 
# chair variants can implement the Chair interface; all coffee table variants can implement the CoffeeTable interface, and so on.

class AbstractFactory

  #@abstract
  def create_product_a
    raise NotImplementedError, "#{self.class} has not implemented method #{__method__}"
  end

    #@abstract
    def create_product_b
      raise NotImplementedError, "#{self.class} has not implemented method #{__method__}"
    end
end
